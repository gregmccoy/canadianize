Above all, he committed to pray for Kia and her children.</p>

      <p>“I am so thankful to God for blessing me,” Kia said. “My children could continue their education, and the income that I got from selling the piglets has enabled me to run the family without much struggle. I am so excited, and I am very thankful to our leaders for their love and concern for poor people like me.”</p>
